first hex to text


In this we have to brute force the key as the text after the operation didn't contain SPYB!TS, 
1 length key combination - 26
2 length key combination - 26 * 26
3 length key combination - 26 * 26 * 26
4 length key combination - 26 * 26 * 26 * 26

Up to 5 length, it's feasible by computer to brute force and the solution key is also of length 3, so we find the answer by this, 

Key in this question:- bit

or 

use this tool with key of length 3 to get flag. https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher
