U are given 3 images img1.jpeg img2.jpeg img3.jpeg
By simply analysing the image it can be observed that these 3 images are somewhat related 
and something in written in img2.jpeg that is not completely visible and readable.

The name suggest the XOR "Exclusive OR" operation may be performed on the some images 
to obtain image img2.jpeg
So for doing the reverse we would take XOR of these 3 image using openCV python library
