Similar to PNG image GIF also have tags and header.
They can be viewed using hex editor such as 
1.Bless Hex editor for Linux 

or 

2. Free Hex Editor Neo(https://www.hhdsoftware.com/free-hex-editor) for windows.



Note : If you are using Free Hex Editor Neo then before you start editing 
click on "edit" in menu bar and then click on "insert mode". Now go for editing the Hex


More information about GIF hex format can be found here https://www.file-recovery.com/gif-signature-format.htm

GIF files start with a fixed-length header (GIF87a or GIF89a) where 7a and 9a specify the version

When you will open GIF in Hex editor you will observe that there is some mismatch in header

"G9a" is written in place of "GIF89a"(I am also attaching one image).

Just make this correction and GIF will work fine and can be opened now.

Flag can be seen in the GIF preview.
