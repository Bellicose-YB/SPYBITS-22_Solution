In intresting tree, 
1. Given file is a .class file which is a compiled file of .java file, so from online decompilers, firstly we get .java file

2. After open it in editor, we can see a code of binary tree, (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/) and it's preorder

3. After identify it, our answer is swapping of index according to preorder index value of a random array.

4. For getting preorder of given array there are two ways,
i) identify the code and do the backtrack of given relation.

ii) Just print the value in between the code.

5. After getting preorder, we just have to swap index values with preorder index values, then we get the answer.
