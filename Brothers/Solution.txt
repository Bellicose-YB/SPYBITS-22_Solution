In this image you are given a corrupted PNG image.

PART 1 :
Open the PNG image in Hex editor.
After IEND tag in the last all the contents of PNG are complete. Anything written after that is of no use to PNG.
So you can hide any data after that and no one will be able to see it.
If scroll to the last u would see a base64 string after IEND.
base64 : UGxlYXNlX2ZpbmRfbXlfYnJvdGhlci1MSVJVIU1Me20wMF9GNGdyXw==
on decoding you would get: 
Please_find_my_brother-LIRU!ML{m00_F4gr_

So , "LIRU!ML{m00_F4gr_" it is encrypted using Caesar cipher.
ðŸ ž19 (ðŸ œ7)	"SPYB!TS{t00_M4ny_" this is first part of our flag.
    First part of flag is : SPYB!TS{t00_M4ny_

PART 2 : 
You have to correct all the PNG chunks in Hex editor, you can learn about them from here :

after correcting all the chunks you will have error free PNG image.

the image have extension of URL
after extending the CTF URL with the text in image you would have a hex string
convert it to text using any decoder
This is the 2nd part of the flag combine it with 1st part to get the final flag
